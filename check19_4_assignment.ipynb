Interpret the estimated coefficients. What are the relations between the target and the explanatory variables?\n",

The prevailing wisom (at least as I know it to be) is that the most important feature impacting the value of a house is its location.

Perhaps it is due to the geographical location of the data: there may not be much difference in neighborhoods (schools, taxes, etc) or there is no perceived difference related to social status. In the Philadelphia area, there is a huge difference in house prices based on zip code, with homes literally one street apart. \n",
