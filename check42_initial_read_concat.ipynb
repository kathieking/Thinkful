    "1. A sample weight is assigned to each record (identified by unique 'SEQN' variable. It is a measure of the number of people in the population represented by that sample person in NHANES, reflecting the unequal probability of selection, nonresponse adjustment, and adjustment to independent population controls.\n",
    "2. Each component subsample has its own designated weight, which accounts for the additional probability of selection into the subsample component, as well as the additional nonresponse. \n",
    "3. It is important to check all of the variables in your analysis and select the weight of the smallest analysis subpopulation that includes all the variables you want to include in your analysis. \n"
