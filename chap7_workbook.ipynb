Many of the passengers on United flight 93 either lived in SF or surronding areas, had family/friends who lived there, or had business there. The impact of the loss of even one life in an event with global impact would ripple out to affect dozens if not hundreds of people, and may be argued to impact the use of Mental Health services in that area.
